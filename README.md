# Focus-Buddy

Focus buddy is a project designed to increase productivity through hardware and software including a windows notification sensor ("NotificationBridge" directory),
and a arduino/sensor array coupled machine learning algorithm ("sensingalgorithm" direcotry)

You can run the notification_receiver.py file along with the windows app to listen to notifications.

you can run the devices.py file with the correct arduino and sensor setup to learn from your environment and output optimal conditions for productivity.
